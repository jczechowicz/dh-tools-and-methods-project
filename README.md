# Decoding Privacy: An NLTK-Powered Exploration of International Privacy Standards

### DESCRIPTION:

New technologies, with the Internet at the forefront, are an integral part of modern reality that is challenging to live without. Due to the architecture of these systems, every user action leaves traces. Users have no control over how their information is utilized. Technology corporations have shaped the Internet according to their own priorities: maximum profits with minimum responsibility for the damage caused by their business models. Internet giants dictate the online experience, arbitrarily deciding which content and accounts remain visible. At the expense of valuable and credible content, their algorithms prioritize emotionally charged material, better-clicking content, and attention-grabbing elements, fostering radicalization and the spread of misinformation.

Cybergiants monitor every online movement. Even if users don't disclose sensitive information, corporations analyze search and click data to craft messages that appeal to users' emotions and drive sales. Because corporations profit from attention, they design services to be as addictive as stimulants, negatively impacting socio-political relationships and mental health. This prompts the question of whether an alternative internet is still feasible.

Despite personal defenses against digital surveillance, such as using a VPN, changing internet browsers, or withdrawing from social media, the most crucial defense for internet users appears to be national laws, policy frameworks, and international agreements worldwide. States wield the power to limit (and potentially halt in the future) the dominance of internet giants.

In the coming weeks, I plan to delve into the topic of international privacy standards. Specifically, I aim to focus on the evolution of trends in personal data legislation over the years. To achieve this, I will analyze the content of key international privacy frameworks prepared by institutions such as: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Council of Europe, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, European Data Protection Directive, International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners and the most essential documents such as [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [Digital Services Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package), as well as others such as:

- [Article 12 The Universal Declaration on Human Rights 1948](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a12)
- [Article 17 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm)
- [Article 16 The Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm)
- [E/CN.4/1990/72: Guidelines for the regulation of computerized personal data files 1990](http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r095.htm)
- [Article 8 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950](http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/html/005.htm)
- [Council of Europe: Recommendations and resolutions of the Committee of Ministers](http://www.coe.int/t/cm/adoptedtexts_en.asp)
- [Council of Europe: Recommendation No.R(99) 5 for the protection of privacy on the Internet 1999](https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=407311&Site=CM)
- [OECD Guidance on Policy and Practice: Privacy Online (book)](http://books.google.com/books/about/Privacy_Online.html?id=zW3dYG_RWYkC)
- [OECD Guidelines on Cross-Border Privacy Law Enforcement 2006-ongoing](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:tOOc_yJ4AaoJ:www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/43/37558845.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiPXw0MIFnHESVz8_zGz3n0QWhiPXw0GtumxKhtmErUudQnepLxa9rmNOvDIpI07DZ4kEu12WeMXBLrX9f0vVmIH3YIDpVi7AlEDGGozE9mXAEcqABC4lGQpDl74W6CEXY8MNFb&sig=AHIEtbQT4Yznfx4i91WnpZTImU1oUc8O6A)
- [OECD Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security 2002](http://www.oecd.org/document/42/0,3746,en_2649_34223_15582250_1_1_1_1,00.html)
- [Article 18 The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam 1990](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html)
- [Article 4.3 Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa 2002](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/achpr/expressionfreedomdec.html)
- [Article 5 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man](http://www.hrcr.org/docs/OAS_Declaration/oasrights3.html)

According to [data](https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide) from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 71% of the world's countries have data protection and privacy legislation and 9% have a draft of such documents â€“ which ultimately demonstrates the relevance of this topic. This brings us to the research question of this project: *How has the understanding of the concept of privacy evolved over the years in national laws, policy frameworks and international agreements around the world?*

To test this claim-that the notion of privacy have changed over the years-this research is going to analyse the international privacy frameworks, with Python's NLTK for text processing. Using NLTK, I'll conduct a frequency analysis to identify the most used words and explore relationships between them. This involves cleaning and tokenizing the text, employing part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. Visualization tools like word clouds will be considered for a more intuitive understanding of the data. Overall, NLTK will play a key role in extracting insights, revealing recurring themes, and highlighting connections within the texts.
